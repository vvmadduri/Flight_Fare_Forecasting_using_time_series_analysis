# Flight_Fare_Forecasting_using_time_series_analysis
The aim of our project is to predict and forecast the flight fares during the vacation season and analyze the data based on flight fare search on various travel websites such as kayak.com, skyscanner.com, and google flights. Our objective is to provide suggestions on the best day of the week to search for and book the flight ticket.
